1.pdf,"Pristina Airport – Possible administrative irregularity regarding tender procedures involving Vendor 1 and Vendor 2

Allegation

Two companies with the same owner took part at least three times in the same Airport tenders.

Background Information

The Kosovo citizen, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Representative, is the owner and Director of the Pristina-based Vendor 1 and also a 51% shareholder of the Pristina-Ljubljana-based company Vendor 2. Both companies have their residences at the same address in Pristina.

Both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 submitted three times in 2003 for the same tenders:

Supply and Mounting of Sonic System in the Fire Station Building. Winner was Vendor 2 with €1,530 followed by Vendor 1 with €1,620. The third company, Vendor 3, did not provide a price offer.

Cabling of Flat Display Information System (FIDS). Winner was Vendor 1 with €15,919 followed by Vendor 2 with €19,248.70. The other two competitors, Vendor 3 and Vendor 4, offered prices of Euro 19,702 and Euro 21,045.

Purchase and fixing of Cramer Antenna. Winner was again Vendor 1 with €3,627.99 followed by Vendor 2 with €3,921. The other two competitors, Vendor 3 and Vendor 4, offered prices of €4,278 and €4,670."
1.pdf,"Investigative details

In his/her interviews conducted on 31st August and 14th September 2004, Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 Representative admitted that the fact that both Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 took part together in three Airport tenders put other competitors at a disadvantage, but alleged both companies have never exchanged information with regard to the price offers.

There were doubts whether both companies Vendor 3 and Vendor 4 exist and submitted bids for the three tenders. The ITF investigation, with support from the Kosovo Organised Crime Bureau (KOCB), has found no reference with regard to the existence of the alleged competitor Vendor 4 in Pristina. The alleged company Vendor 3 was found to be a supermarket located in Prizren.

The above-mentioned facts are already part of the ITF case no. 286/04 that was submitted to the International Prosecutor, UNMIK Department of Justice, in October 2004. On 1 December 2004, the ITF contacted the International Prosecutor for a legal assessment of this case. Although this case would clearly be a breach of Economic Law, there is no applicable law in Kosovo for the time being."
10.pdf,"""An interoffice memorandum providing an “outstanding issues update to Official 2”, from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the office of Official 2 dated 18 May 2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers were provided by companies on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance. However, a more likely explanation is the date of the interoffice memorandum has been incorrectly dated, since the document contains reference dates relating to project “events” which post date 18 May 2001. At paragraph 2b, the interoffice memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation to tender was based on summary documents."""

(The contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channeled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.)

The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is signed by three parties, who are also listed as having attended the bid opening session. This indicates that the composition of the bid opening committee and the evaluation committee overlapped.

When asked about this issue in interview DOTI Official 2 confirmed that he/she was both on the bid opening committee and was a member of the evaluation committee. He/she added that the people who evaluated the offers signed the evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regulations, which segregate the two roles.

But the report was produced by a professional pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree of integrity.”

The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated that he/she was unhappy about the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she commented that the airport engineer should have questioned it.

The ITF does not have sufficient technical knowledge to assess the adequacy of the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divisional Manager to Staff Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the possibility that it was not up to specification in certain areas."""
10.pdf,"""INVESTIGATION DETAILS

This part of the investigation relates to a tender for a contract for the extension of the Cargo Terminal Apron at Pristina Airport. The value of the contract was €774,318.63.

Allegation 1

(Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo apron did not comply with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear instructions on drawings and plans.)

A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluation Company to the PEAP Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the Evaluation Company was commissioned to produce a preliminary design for the Cargo Terminal at Pristina Airport. The design also provided for the construction of the Cargo Apron Extension."""
10.pdf,"""At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension evaluation report dated 2 August 2001, the committee notes that the bidding documents did not include clear instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was recommended that negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Vendor, on further details of the scope of works.

In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.

When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer was asked this question, he/she would indicate that the tender specifications were technically deficient and did not comply with Article 23.3."""
10.pdf,"""Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised DOTI Official 1 (Department of Transport and Infrastructure). The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer 1, Airport Engineer 2, and Airport Engineer 3, and later by a consultant from the Consulting Company.

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed. Under him were the PEAP Official and ATCS Official (Air Traffic Control Services).

On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.

It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined."""
10.pdf,"""METHODOLOGY

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999. UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport."""
10.pdf,"""Allegation 4:

(Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own test results to confirm the quality of its own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflict of interest.)

An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 to the Procurement Official, signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, indicates that DOTI Official 1 authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memorandum also adds that the work was inadvertently not included in the original contract.

DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to progress the cargo apron tender, he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/she added that only after the tests were done could the tender go ahead. However, the evaluation report at paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not appear to have been included in the tender documents. In addition, a letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, but apparently not received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, according to a manuscript note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it carried out its own soil tests."""
10.pdf,"""DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical details of the Cargo Apron extension project were taken from the cargo terminal study produced by the Evaluation Company and pasted into the tender document specifications. Thereafter, it was up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the specification.

According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the tender had been launched, had been angry with the Evaluation Company for allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of their study as the tender specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also expressed concern at the method used for preparing the tender documents, as from an engineering point of view the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. However, DOTI Official 2 stated that if the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare the tender documents, it would have cost more money. He/she had therefore prepared the tender documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procurement Official at the CPE to review and help him with the procurement exercise.

Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer, and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official, as to the procurement documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expressed the view that neither the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Officer would have had the technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications.

DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no engineering expert to support his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a fact that made his/her work very difficult."""
10.pdf,"""DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for the shortcomings in the tender documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE must also bear a certain amount of responsibility.

The shortcomings in the tender documents are likely to have prejudiced some companies in their decision as to submitting bids for the tenders, since they may not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a result.

Three persons are indicated to have both attended the bid opening session as well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in conflict with UN regulations.

Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser.

Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron, thereby “self certifying” its own work and presenting a potential conflict of interest."""

(S//SI//NF)

(S//NF) In preparing for the 26 to 27 April visit to Washington by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) apparently wanted to come up with a simple message regarding climate change with which the U.S. can agree. Accordingly, METI has pushed three principles: technical development, energy conservation and nuclear energy, and participation of all countries in the future framework. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) apparently wants Abe to mention at the bilateral summit Japan's goal of reducing carbon emissions by half by 2050 as part of the ""Abe initiative,"" which will be announced in late May. The MFA was considering not informing the U.S. in advance of its intention, because the ministry did not expect Washington to approve of such a goal, based on the U.S. reaction to climate change issues so far. It was apparently decided at a briefing at the Prime Minister's official residence that Abe will clearly state the goal at the bilateral summit, with advance notification to the United States. Japan anticipates no major harm to the Japanese­U.S. relationship as a result. "

Approach (TS//SI//NF)

(TS//SI//NF) Japanese climate change officials apparently plan to continue promoting the sectoral approach despite criticism from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and some European Union officials. Fatih Birol, Chief Economist of the IEA, reportedly warned the Japanese in mid­-May that they are pushing too hard to promote the sectoral approach and may be perceived as offering this approach as the only option for reducing carbon emissions. He also cautioned that the sectoral approach is not yet understood and that Tokyo must clarify the concept and promote understanding and trust among the nations concerned. Masakazu Toyoda of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry expressed frustration at this criticism then laid out three advantages of the sectoral approach: first, the approach is designed to get China, India, and the U.S. on board; second, this approach allows developed countries to avoid expending unnecessary efforts to reduce carbon emissions in areas covered by the sectoral approach; and third, the sectoral approach will, in Toyoda's estimation, not result in any economic or industrial loss for developed or developing nations. One Japanese official thinks that it may be difficult for the Europeans to implement the sectoral approach in sectors such as electricity, which is already subject to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). He suggested that the ultimate solution is dependent upon the EU accepting a method of determining a figure for total carbon emissions reductions that includes the electricity sector. Toyoda claimed that businesses from several sectors  ­including steel, aluminum, cement, and petroleum­­are threatening to cease their European operations if the ETS continues as is."

(TS//SI//OC/NF) Officials in the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) appeared recently to be seeking ways to prevent damage to relations with the U.S. over the ministry's decision to delay the importation of U.S.-­origin cherries, a decision driven by Japanese politicians and growers. MAFF was alarmed by the very strong reaction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Tokyo's ruling that imports could not commence until the end of this month, when a pilot program involving inspections in the U.S. Pacific Northwest by a MAFF inspector is expected to be concluded satisfactorily. One approach under consideration is to have the ministry admit to Washington, through back channels, that the decision had been the product of political pressure. Also, it was recommended that the U.S. be notified that­­unlike in the beef dispute­­imports could begin as soon as the result of on­site inspection is confirmed, rather than after the inspector had returned to Japan and more tests conducted. The principal fear among the Japanese is that the issue will become similarly politicized, possibly at senior levels, in Washington.

110.pdf,"The EU and Japan were engaged as of early December in strategy sessions aimed at a common handling policy to deal with potential U.S. moves in the Doha Round negotiations. There was a conviction in both Brussels and Tokyo, according to Japanese reporting, that great care must be taken to avoid falling prey to U.S. moves designed to extort concessions through exaggerated initial demands. Regarding U.S. domestic supports for agriculture, for example, Japanese Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Toshikatsu Matsuoka and EU Agriculture Commissioner Marianne Fischer-Boel recently pondered whether to jump-start the negotiations by asking the U.S. for a specific dollar figure in reduced supports. The problem for the EU, it was noted, is whether or not the proposed $17 billion mark is an acceptable point of departure, since U.S. supports at that level are judged to be in no way comparable to the breadth of market access that Brussels put on the table last July. A figure of $14 to $15 billion would be more in line with the EU's thinking, Fischer-Boel indicated. The EU also had concerns that Washington may be headed for a showdown with developing countries over special products. As for sensitive products, Fischer-Boel's deputy chef de cabinet, Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, hinted to the Japanese that the EU may be willing to go lower than its current official limit of 8 percent, possibly as low as 4 to 5 percent; however, that would be hard for Japan to accept. Borchardt also tried to allay Japanese fears that the EU might try again to enter into a bilateral, under-the-table deal with the U.S. (as had happened in Cancun in 2003), saying that Brussels had learned its lesson with respect to such back-door actions."

Merkel and Sarkozy, evidently brooking no excuses with respect to Italy's current predicament, pressured the PM to announce strong, concrete palliatives and then to implement them in order to show that his government is serious about its debt problem. Sarkozy was said to have told Berlusconi that while the latter's claims about the solidity of the Italian banking system may be true in theory, financial institutions there could soon ""pop"" like the cork in a champagne bottle, that ""words are no longer enough,"" and that Berlusconi must now ""make decisions."" Also on the 24th, Valentini indicated that EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy had urged Italy to undertake policies aimed at reducing the impression within the EU that the country is weighed down with an enormous debt at a moment in time when it also is struggling with low productivity and showing little dynamism. In Van Rompuy's opinion, Spain is the model that Italy should now be seeking to emulate."

The objective now, Netanyahu said, is to keep the Palestinians from using this issue as a pretext to block a resumption of talks or to advance unrealistic claims that could risk sinking the peace negotiations altogether. Continuing, he asserted that the tension has only been heightened by the absence of direct contact between himself and the U.S. President. In response, Berlusconi promised to put Italy at Israel's disposal in helping mend the latter's ties with Washington.

(According to press reports, leaders from 16 countries, including the members of the G-8 plus China, India, Brazil, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, South Africa, and Mexico, plan to discuss climate change on the margins of the G-8 summit in Japan.) Masaharu Kono, Japan's G-8 sherpa, emphasized Tokyo's position in an exchange with his German counterpart, Bernd Pfaffenback, on 17 June, while Pfaffenback provided his country's take on the issues to be addressed at Lake Toya. The German also noted that, in response to a U.S. request, his country would likely give up its demand for a 25- to 45-percent mid-term carbon dioxide reduction at the MEM. In addition, he does not believe that the emerging economies are willing to go beyond the Bali language at present, his feeling being that they prefer instead to wait until next year's G-8 summit in Copenhagen, because they do not wish to give up things now that they might be prepared to give up later. It is also Pfaffenback's position that a failure of the emerging economies to accept a long-term goal with numbers, even in brackets, would pose difficulties for the G-8 and possibly lead to a clash at the summit itself if there is no fallback position."

In that regard, Ban considered the Poznan Conference to be very important as a ""bridge"" toward Copenhagen. Ban also praised Merkel for her personal efforts regarding the issue of combating climate change and for encouraging other EU leaders to agree on the issue. For her part, Merkel was optimistic that the EU Summit would come to an agreement, although she acknowledged that the tough issue would involve carbon dioxide trading. Both Ban and Merkel favored holding a mini-summit in early 2009 to involve the new U.S. administration, believing that it is important to get a clear idea of U.S. intentions.

In the IAU memo, reference is made to a letter of complaint dated 28-06-04 from Vendor 1, a company that competed for the tender and that was subsequently awarded the single source contract to supply summer uniforms. The author of the letter, Vendor 1 Manager, alleged the existence of rumours and witnesses in the matter of the bribery of Procurement Officer 1, Pristina Airport, and the Finance Officer, Pristina Airport, by one of Vendor 1 Manager’s competitors in the tender process, Vendor 2. Vendor 1 Manager’s letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by: replacing a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a member of the Finance Department, the Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favouring Vendor 2 in the tender process.
During the course of the investigation, Procurement Officer 1 told the ITF that, following the cancellation of the competitive tender, Vendor 1 Manager had made utterances to him/her that Procurement Officer 1 had interpreted as a threat.

15.pdf,"""Allegation

In July 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) was provided with a copy of a letter dated 28 May 2004, from the Cargo Manager of an Airline to a Staff Member of Public Enterprise Airport Pristina. In the letter, the Cargo Manager referred to several problems relative to an Invoice for April 2004 issued by the Cargo Department of Pristina Airport for the handling of the outgoing mail of a Member State’s KFOR. At the time, Pristina Airport staff could not locate a record of this invoice in the airport’s financial records, and, therefore, the commission of fraud on the part of staff in the Cargo Department was suspected."""
15.pdf,"""Background

Pristina Airport is the Airline’s cargo handling agent for both imports and exports and the Airline is the Member State’s KFOR’s mail handling agent. Pristina Airport collects mail-handling revenues on behalf of the Airline and deposits these revenues to the airline’s bank account after deducting the appropriate commission.

The issues identified in the letter by the Airline Cargo Manager related to the high rate (€0.50/kg) charged by Pristina Airport for handling outgoing mail; the fact that the Invoice had been incorrectly sent to the Member State’s KFOR instead of their agent, the Airline; and the inappropriate addition of Value Added Tax (VAT), which is not applicable to international traffic."""
16.pdf,"ID/OIOS requested DRA logistics officer 2 to review each individual bid and to explain his/her annotations. DRA logistics officer 2 pointed out that Vendor 4, Vendor 5 and Vendor 6 had offered virtually the same technical device. He/she found out that the “Gotive H41 IB” model offered by Vendor 6 did not substantially differ from the “Gotive H41” model offered by Vendor 4 and Vendor 5. DRA logistics officer 2 stated that the “Gotive H41” model complied with all the requirements laid out in the technical specifications and pointed out that this device was very well protected against environmental impact, notably in the field. According to DRA logistics officer 2, the PDA model offered by Vendor 1 was not a rugged PDA; it did not comply with the IP54 protection standards essential for outdoor use. At first glance, Vendor 1 appeared to be the lowest bidder, because they offered the largest number of PDAs for the stated price ceiling. However, the product did not comply with the technical specifications and hence would be inappropriate for use by KVS veterinarians. As such, the members of the evaluation panel did not short-list Vendor 1 for further examination."
16.pdf,"In terms of the priority selection criteria of the evaluation panel, DRA logistics officer 2 stated that the DRA had advised them to monitor not only the technical specifications but to focus particularly on Section VII of the Bidding Documents “Obligatory Requirements to be fulfilled by the bidders.” DRA logistics officer 2 highlighted the criteria of after-warranty repair service located within Kosovo and repair or replacement within five working days (based on the existing regulations in Kosovo as to notification, registration and recording of information concerning movement of animals within five days of the movement). Therefore, if a PDA device used for the communication of such data broke down and was not replaced within a week, farmers and veterinarians would run the risk of not complying with the law."
16.pdf,"In order to find out why the lowest bidder, Vendor 1, was still not selected, ID/OIOS spoke separately with two members of the bid evaluation panel who explained the evaluation process and why the panel recommended the selected bidder, Vendor 4. ID/OIOS was told that the evaluation panel examined the bid documents submitted by the six pre-qualified bidders and made comments and annotations on the table provided to them by the DRA logistics officer. The evaluation panel relied heavily on the technical expertise of one panel member, DRA logistics officer 2, who was responsible for the evaluation of the technical features of the PDAs offered. DRA logistics officer 2 told ID/OIOS that his/her handwritten entries on the table were based on the discussions of the entire evaluation panel, but that he/she independently verified that the product offered by each bidder did possess the declared features and that he/she checked the technical data submitted by the individual bidders with the product datasheet and brochures included in the bidding documents."
16.pdf,"The complainant raised two main issues: firstly, that the bid submitted by Vendor 1, was the lowest bid because it offered the most number of devices within the ceiling price. Secondly, although two other bidders offered the same product as the winning bidder, but at a lower price, they had not been selected. The PRIO preliminary report also identified these issues. ID/OIOS Investigators reviewed all eight bids submitted and noted that DRA logistics officer 1 had disqualified two, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3, because neither the Vendor 2 nor the Vendor 3 bid was substantially responsive in that the total price of the product offered exceeded the price ceiling of €135,000. During his/her pre-qualification of bids, DRA logistics officer 1 noted that Vendor 2 did not include taxes “CIP” Pristina Kosovo as required in the bid document, meaning the total price would exceed the ceiling of €135,000 by more than €17,000; and Vendor 3’s total offer did not include its yearly €16,500 maintenance surcharge fee, causing its bid to exceed the stated price ceiling by more than €15,000."
16.pdf,"In late 2002, the EAR consultant prepared the technical specifications for the PDAs based on the proposal in SPUVESEK’s inception report of August 2002. Based on these specifications, the DRA launched an initial tender in November 2003 for the PDAs, inclusive of both hardware and software. All bids submitted exceeded the amount set aside for the purchase of the PDAs (€170,000), therefore that tender was cancelled in February 2004 based on advice from the Central Procurement Entity (CPE). A second tender for the purchase of the required PDAs was then launched in April 2004, using the same technical specifications. For the second tender, the DRA provided the bidders with a price ceiling of €135,000 and requested that they state the number of devices in total that the company could offer within the price ceiling. On 19 May 2004, the deadline for the submission of bids, the DRA had received eight bids. As required, the bids were opened and certified by members of a bid-opening panel consisting of DRA logistics officer 1, a DRA procurement officer, DRA employee 1 and a DRA finance officer. The complainant told ID/OIOS that the bid opening process occurred without incident and in accordance with correct procedural requirements."
16.pdf,"The evidence adduced by the investigation further confirms that the PDAs offered by Vendor 1 did not conform to the technical specifications of the ITB. Although the complainant offered the largest number of PDAs within the stated ceiling price, the PDAs offered were not appropriate for the designated use as set forth in the bid documents. ID/OIOS determined that the procurement exercise was conducted in accordance with the UN Financial Rules and Regulations governing procurement and with UNMIK’s Finance Administrative Instruction 2/1999 on public procurements using KCB funds.
RECOMMENDATION Based on the above, ID/OIOS makes the following the recommendation: Recommendation 1: It is recommended that UNMIK take note of ID/OIOS’ findings and conclusions and advise DRA staff members, DRA employee 2 and DRA logistics officer 1 of the result of this investigation. (ID Rec. IV04/374/01)"
16.pdf,"An internal Pillar II review by the Policy Review and Internal Oversight Unit (PRIO) highlighted possible irregularities in its preliminary report on the procurement exercise with a recommendation for further investigation. This report was provided to ID/OIOS with a request for further investigation. Based on the issues raised in the complaint and subsequently in the PRIO Unit’s preliminary report, ID/OIOS investigated the entire tender process to determine whether any violations of UN rules had occurred.  

The Directorate of Rural Affairs (DRA) is located within UNMIK Civil Administration (Pillar II); it was formed in October 2001 out of the former Department of Agriculture in the Joint Administrative Interim Structure. The DRA comprises Veterinary Services & Veterinary Border Control, Phytosanitary Border Control and Public Forests. The DRA remains a reserved area under Security Council Resolution 1244 and the staff are United Nations staff members subject to the UN Rules and Regulations. Also, the DRA undertakes its own procurement for all  of the divisions within the DRA.  "
16.pdf,"In the preliminary PRIO report, the price estimates as stated in the EAR consultant’s inception report showed five different PDA models with integrated scanner capabilities. The prices of the PDA models shown ranged from USD $323.38 to USD $818.30. ID/OIOS adduced that the initial estimates were of regular PDAs, not the more rugged PDAs specified in the technical specifications and required for use by veterinarians working in inclement weather conditions. ID/OIOS also found that the estimates were obtained from the Internet for the inception report and did not include the features that would make it technically appropriate for the veterinarians in the field. The actual technical specifications prepared by the EAR consultant later envisaged a more rugged, durable product that would be water, dust and drop resistant. The price per unit of “rugged” PDAs, as required by the technical specifications, is higher than the initial estimate made in the inception report. ID/OIOS verified this through Internet research."
2.pdf,"The investigation conducted by the ITF clearly documented that Prishtina Airport management failed to perform their duties in accordance with the general principles outlined above. In particular, the use of the assets allocated to the ATCS by the KTA in 2002 was inadequately documented and the performance of the ATCS Finance Office in that respect was unsatisfactory. This poor performance even caused financial damage to the UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA, as demonstrated in this report. The work of the ATCS Finance Office was under direct supervision of the ATCS Official and the oversight responsibility was in the hands of the Division Manager. Both of them in their respectful capacity failed to perform their duties according to expected standards and they failed to promote the best interest of UNMIK Pillar 4 –KTA, as their employer."
2.pdf,"Documentation obtained by the ITF from the Prishtina Airport clearly shows that ATCS management failed to introduce, or enforce, rules and regulations that would guarantee proper use of the allocated funds and provided transparent documentation of this process. A significant amount of the cash withdrawals by the ATCS was used for training opportunities for employees of the ATCS, who attended courses in a number of countries including Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the cash advances were not all related to the ATCS Official’s travel, rather for a significant number of Employees. The necessity of the frequent travel of the ATCS Official remains questionable, as the available documentation does not provide clear proof that the ATCS Official’s travel was business related or justified."
2.pdf,"The ATCS Official stated that in 2002, he/she was not sufficiently experienced in financial management, therefore he/she hired Finance Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 who both had educational background and professional experience in this field. He/she said that he/she was sure that the ATCS money was spent in line with the requests, but he/she accepted that the documentation was very poor and unacceptable, even for the minimal standards required. The ATCS Official agreed that he/she and his/her staff were diligent in requesting funds for ATCS operations, however, were generally deficient when addressing the need for proper documentation of the actual expenditures. The ATCS Official indicated that he/she trusted his/her staff; that they were professional; and it was only very recently that he/she realized that he/she should have devoted more effort to their supervision."
2.pdf,"The ATCS Official further indicated that his/her superiors approved all the bills that were in the petty cash binders, including, for example: €525,00 “Present for International Staff”; €410,00 “Present for Official 3 (Nokia 8850)”; €918,00 “Palm organizer for the ATCS Official and Official 3”; €1.176,00 “Recharging scratch cards VALA 900 (20*23.52) + (12*58.8)”; €960,00 “Payment for mobile phone” and €940,00 “Rent a car for Head of Department”. The ATCS Official stated that all the presents purchased from petty cash were also approved, however, he/she could not support this claim with any documentation. The ATCS Official added that had those bills not been authorized, the ATCS would have not been able to get further cash as the approval for further cash withdrawals was conditioned by proper documentation and certification of previous spending. He/she insisted that the sums paid for refreshments/food/restaurant bills from the petty cash fund (hundreds of Euros) were all authorized by his/her superiors, but that they did not request written justifications from him/her; the bill was allegedly sufficient proof of expenditure"
2.pdf,"The ITF interviewed the ATCS Official on two occasions and he/she acknowledged that cases 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2002 (the time period up to 30 June 2002) all show numerous irregularities. He/she studied those files in detail and concluded that all four contained sufficient information to justify the allocation of money for the planned travel of the ATCS staff, but that the documentation of the expenses was very poor. 

The ATCS Official also acknowledged that cases 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002 and 08/2002 (the time period after 01 July 2002) also showed numerous irregularities such as missing bills to prove payments, missing signatures of ATCS staff proving that they had received the per-diem, missing flight ticket and boarding passes proving that the travel was in fact executed. The ITF concluded that it is very likely that those funds were paid to the ATCS employees on per-diem or salaries, however sufficient documentation to prove those payments was not available to the ITF investigators despite numerous attempts made in order to secure such documentation. As a matter of practice, the ATCS Official was formally certifying his/her own expenses during the business trips. The ATCS Official could not provide any acceptable explanations to those irregularities"
2.pdf,"The Division Manager said that the ATCS Official would bring to him/her a request in which he/she would detail the need for cash and that when the Division Manager found the justification sufficient and in line with needs of the Airport, he/she would approve it. The ATCS Official would then be responsible for the proper use of these funds and keeping the financial records of the expenditure. In fact, the ATCS Official had to sign for the bank check before it could be cashed at the bank and therefore he/she had the cash in his/her “custody”. The Division Manager indicated that it was not possible for him/her to check every bill and invoice; therefore he /she delegated the authority for financial management to the ATCS Official."
2.pdf,"The ITF interviewed Official 1 at Prishtina Airport. He/She stated that in May 2002 he/she travelled with the ATCS Official and Official 3 to the UK in order to negotiate conditions and fine-tune the training arrangements for the ATCS staff (request 46/2002). During this mission they all received free accommodation, all meals were provided as well as transport from Shinfield Park to London upon their return. When he/she returned to Prishtina he/she was not requested to return any of the per-diem, adding that he/she knew that the ATCS Official and Official 3 also did not return any of the allocated funds (€1158)"
2.pdf,"BACKGROUND INFORMATION A review of the airport’s bank accounts and documents related to airport operations, contracts, and financial matters revealed a number of cash withdrawals from the ATCS bank account, many of them in €10.000 increments. Between July 2002 and November 2003, an amount of €642.000 was withdrawn in cash. The majority of the withdrawals were identified as being for air travel and related expenses for the then the ATCS Official; similarly for other ATCS employees; and also for the so-called ‘petty cash’ purposes. The forensic audit report of February 2003 highlighted that the ATCS Official travelled frequently and questioned whether the trips were necessary, or were approved. It was established that on 01 July 2002, the new Division Manager, Airport Sector UNMIK Pillar 4 was appointed with overall responsibility for Pristina Airport. The ATCS Official was in charge of the Department, which included day to-day management of the ATCS Finance Office. Finance Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 were employed as ATCS Finance Officers, both of them directly supervised by the ATCS Official. It should be also mentioned that the ATCS Official, Finance Officer 1 and Finance Officer 2 were working at ATCS prior to the arrival of the Division Manager."
2.pdf,"IV. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS
The ITF investigation was focused on the examination of two main areas; a) travel arrangements and cash expenses related to the official travel of ATCS staff and b) handling of the so-called ATCS petty cash. During this investigation the ITF Investigators:
• Reviewed existing procedures related to the cash withdrawals in 2002 and 2003 in view of establishing whether those procedures were properly followed and enforced by the management of ATCS; • Examined ATCS bank account and related records; • Examined the cash withdrawal requests, supporting documentation, and receipts including airline tickets, hotel bills, and other receipts;"
2.pdf,"The ITF investigation was focused on the examination of two main areas; a) travel arrangements and cash expenses related to the official travel of ATCS staff and b) handling of the so-called ATCS petty cash. During this investigation the ITF Investigators:
• Reviewed the so-called petty cash files and related documentation; • Cross-checked the staff details on record and their employment roles during the time period in question, including their official right to authorize cash withdrawals from ATCS bank account; • Compared signatures found on the examined documents against the signatures on the staff files; • Cross-checked specific sums against the airport “excel” cash spreadsheets and the master bank account. (Note: the “excel” spreadsheet system has been in place since mid-2002 and is used to maintain a “cashbook”); • Interviewed ATCS staff, in particular the Division Manager; the ATCS Officials; and Finance Officers 1 and 2. ITF Investigators also interviewed Official 1 at Prishtina Airport, and the Official 2 at Prishtina Airport."
2.pdf,"During the review of available documentation, the ITF investigators identified a number of problems related to the existing procedures and practices at ATCS Finance Office. Having finalized the document review they interviewed available ATCS staff that was directly involved in approving the cash withdrawals and subsequently ATCS staff that handled the cash and related documentation at the ATCS Finance Office, or that travelled on training to Italy and the United Kingdom. The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 1, working at ATCS Finance Office during the period September 2000 to December 2003. Finance Officer 1 described the procedures that were in place during 2002 and 2003 and identified Employee 1, Employee 2 and the Division Manager as “A” class signatories and Employee 3, Employee 4, Employee 5 and the ATCS Official as “B” class signatories for the UNMIK Aviation Transport and Airport Prishtina bank accounts. Those listed “A” class signatories were the only people authorized to withdraw cash from the ATCS bank accounts."

2.pdf,"The ITF interviewed Finance Officer 2, working at the ATCS Finance Office, who stated he/she has been employed by the ATCS since 01 April 2002. Finance Officer 2 provided detailed information with regard to the financial procedures and practices at the ATCS Finance Office and indicated that based on his/her previous experience in dealing with finances for a number of companies (local and international), he/she found the ATCS Finance Office to be “quite” disorganized. For example, the office did not have in place proper structures and computer software to deal with the financial issues including cash, even though the amounts of money they were processing were quite high. Finance Officer 2 allegedly tried to suggest some improvements, but the ATCS Official told him/her that it was the way the UNMIK wanted to deal with money and that he/she should follow his/her instructions. Since Finance Officer 2 was concerned that he/she might lose his/her job if he/she raised any further objections, he/she decided to work as instructed by the ATCS Official."
2.pdf,"The ITF interviewed Official 4 at the Pristina Airport. Official 4 was requested to review several files related to business travel of ATCS staff during 2002 and was shown documents: 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2002. He/She concluded that all four might contain sufficient information to justify allocation of funds for the planned travel of ATCS staff, however, none had sufficient information that would document how those allocated funds were spent. Information contained in the file 46/2002 suggests that this document might have been created after-the-fact, as had this request been submitted for approval on 25 May 2002 (as indicated), it would be impossible for the approval dates written on the document to be 21 May 2002 and 22 May 2002 respectively. Also, documents attached to request 55/2002 were printouts indicating flight reservations, but they do not prove that the travel was executed. None of the four files contained original flight tickets, boarding passes or original bills, nor do they contain sufficient proof that all the funds allocated to the travellers were provided to them by the ATCS Official, as the travellers did not sign for them. Without flight tickets and boarding passes it is not sufficiently documented that the ATCS personnel travelled on those missions."
2.pdf,"Official 4 was also requested to review the files dated after 01 July 2002, in particular files 01/2002; 05/2002; 06/2002; 07/2002 and 08/2002. Having studied those files, he/she concluded that the files revealed the same absence of required documentation as the other cases identified in paragraph 16 above. Official 4 was asked to review several files related to the so-called petty cash transactions and see whether there were any irregularities. He/She concluded that significant efforts were made by the ATCS Official to justify the cash withdrawals, however while the cash appeared to have been provided, there was very little effort to properly document how those funds were spent."
2.pdf,"ITF Investigators interviewed the Division Manager on two occasions and he/she explained that staff travel expenses were high because of the necessity to train nineteen air traffic controllers, seven meteorological forecasters and six aeronautical information service officers. All of the above staff received classroom and on-the-job training around the world and that Pristina Airport was responsible for expenses incurred. He/she said that the airport has no rules or regulations regarding travel and that there are no forms to complete requesting authorization for travel or documentation authorizing travel. The Division Manager was aware that the ATCS Official, as the supervisor of many of those who travelled, would frequently visit staff whilst undertaking their respective courses"
2.pdf,"Finance Officer 1 also confirmed that the Division Manager and the ATCS Official supervised the work of the ATCS Finance Office. He/she further indicated that whenever there was a requirement for a larger cash payment, (for example, an official travel), Finance Officer 1 or Finance Officer 2 would prepare a “request for cash withdrawal” that would be signed by the ATCS Official and subsequently assessed and approved by the Division Manager. 

Finance Officer 1 was given the opportunity to review documentation related to the travel of ATCS staff in 2002 prior to the takeover of the ATCS by UNMIK Pillar 4 – KTA on 1 July 2002. During this exercise, Finance Officer 1 established that “requests for cash” 46/2002; 49/2002; 55/2002 and 59/2002 had proper justification sufficient for the authorization of cash allocation, but all lacked documentation that would indicate how those funds were spent. Finance Officer 1 was not able to provide satisfactory explanations for the identified irregularities and had no recollection that the ATCS Official ever made any checks of the financial files at ATCS Finance Office."
21.pdf,"Finance Assistant 1 claimed he had not noticed the footer on them. When ID/OIOS asked why the photocopies of the forged faxes in the UNDP finance file did not have the footer, he disclaimed responsibility for the photocopying.

At the time of these incidents, two photocopying assistants had been working on an ad hoc basis at the finance office and had access to departmental files. Photocopying Assistant 1 was a relative of The Finance Department Supervisor, and Photocopying Assistant 2, was the daughter of Finance Assistant 2. Photocopying Assistant 2 assisted her father periodically without pay. OIOS was informed that the two assistants helped in the preparation of the end of month financial returns, which included retrieving documents from various files, copying them and returning them to the files. Photocopying Assistant 1 was working at the finance office at the relevant time period, but it has not been fully established when Photocopying Assistant 2 worked at the office. No timesheets were kept for either assistant.

Review of procedures at UNON, UNEP Narobi and UNDP Bratislava in connection with payments of this sort showed that
• UNDP Bratislava relies on the authorizing signatures on the faxes and does not verify their authenticity with the agency;
• UNDP Bratislava maintains a sign-in sheet which requires a signature and identity information, but it was kept haphazardly at the time of these incidents;
• UNDP Bratislava disperses cheques upon proof of identity, which is recorded on the back of the cheque, and the payee signs the original cash disbursement voucher upon receipt of the cheque, but the finance office does not retain a copy of the payee’s proof of identification;
• UNDP Bratislava does not maintain a mail log;
• While procedures for reconciling accounts between UNON and UNDP were in place, UNON did not attempt to reconcile the August 2002 UNDP Bratislava account for more than a year after it was purportedly submitted; and
• UNEP Narobi stated that it has had several problems with fraudulent payments by UNDP offices."

Mr. Mzumara was also a recipient of a copy of the email that was addressed to Ambassador Negroponte by the staff member.
On the same day, Mr. Mzumara replied through an email to the staff member and concurred with his action of writing to the Ambassador. However, Mr. Mzumara pointed out to the staff member that he was concerned that he, the staff member, was writing to persons outside the Organization. Mr. Mzumara stated that “Yes I thought as much. My concern was you were going out of the system and this is not in line with the Conditions of Service. See what comes out of it”. The staff member responded\ via email dated 29 January 2003 and stated that, “Thanks that I have been told. This question was brought in the JAB in Nairobi. With a few phone calls, the case was shelved. The lady who broadcasted the message is the one who wrote to White House and the Vice Presidents of the USA. If the internal justice system had functioned every thing would have been kept within the system. My hope was Negroponte being in the UN Secretariat would do damage control and get somehow the Boss to address the problem, in the best interest of the Secretary General. The ladies will continue writing to Human Rights Organizations, especially those that are tired. It may not produce immediate results but a lot of damage will be done”.

The email had an attachment that was addressed to the Executive Secretary of ECA and highlighted allegations of sexual harassment and rape perpetrated by some senior officials of ECA within the ECA Complex. The title to the attachment was “Crimes of Rape and Maladministration within the compound of ECA”. The document was also copied to the Secretary-General, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and senior officials in the UN System. 

“Abebe’s” complaint to the American Government was that the Executive Secretary, ECA had failed to take action against staff members who were alleged to have sexually harassed and raped ten women staff members of ECA. “Abebe” was therefore asking the American Government to intervene on behalf of the aggrieved

“Hiwot Abebe” email of 26 January 2003

During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that on 26 January 2003, an anonymous person, using the identities of “Hiwot Abebe” sent an email to the President and Vice-President of the United States of America. The email was also addressed to Senator John Kerry and Senator Dodd of the United States Senate. The email had an attachment that was addressed to the Executive Secretary of ECA and highlighted allegations of sexual harassment and rape perpetrated by some senior officials of ECA within the ECA Complex. The title to the attachment was “Crimes of Rape and Maladministration within the compound of ECA”. The document was also copied to the Secretary-General, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and senior officials in the UN System."""

When interviewed the ACGD Officer told ID/OIOS that Official 2 had asked him to pay miscellaneous expenses and DSA to the participants of the Seychelles conference. He said that ECA had written to UNDP Mauritius, who asked UNDP HQ for authority to transfer funds to Barclays in Seychelles. The ACGD Officer then cashed the funds and disbursed DSA to participants.

He said that on 17 February 1999 he paid the first group of participants at the hotel in the presence of the UNDP Officer. He indicated his payment to participants on the list by placing asterisks against their names. On 18 February 1999 Barclays paid the other participants using the attendance list supplied by the ACGD Officer. Upon receipt of identification from the payees, the bank tellers had the participant sign his/her name on the attendance list and paid the DSA. The ACGD Officer said that he was present when the bank tellers paid the remaining participants and that after the payments were made, the attendance list was returned to him."""

The ACGD Officer explained these discrepancies by suggesting that a bank employee might have tampered with the DSA list and forged signatures of participants who did not attend and then pocketed their DSA. He said that he dealt with the manager; a teller and a go-between person and that any one of them could have falsely signed the DSA list. However, he had previously acknowledged that he had witnessed the payments being made by the Bank staff and he had not raised any questions or concerns then or at any time before being questioned by ID/OIOS Investigators on this point. However, he claimed to be surprised by the discrepancies pointed out by ID/OIOS. He then acknowledged that he had received memoranda from Official 4 asking him to account, amongst other things, for the moneys that he had been given for DSA, but he thought that the matter had been settled despite the unaccounted discrepancies."""

UNEP management advised ID/OIOS that UNEP Staff Member 1 and UNEP Staff Member 2 performed well, which they felt justified their decision to grant them contracts at the high level, although UNEP Staff Member 1 did not have the requisite educational background and UNEP Staff Member 2 had little environmental expertise prior to his consultancy with BTF.

(i) Allegation 1. While working for the BTF and PCAU, UNEP Staff Member 1,UNEP Staff Member 2, and UNEP/PCAU Consultant maintained an ongoing relationship with their former company, thereby creating a conflict of interest.

During the time UNEP Staff Member 1 held a consultancy contract with UNEP, the former company had no contractual relationship with UNEP. Although this created the appearance of a conflict of interest, none was established."""
27.pdf,"""During the course of the investigation, ID/OIOS learned that the former company received contracts and extensions of contracts with BTF through UNOPS without competitive bidding, in violation of Financial Regulation 1.2 which states that ""Procurement functions include all actions necessary for the acquisition, by purchase or lease, of property, including products and real property, and of services, including works. The following general principles shall be given due consideration when exercising the procurement functions of the United Nations: (a) Best value for money; (6) fairness, integrity and transparency; (c) Effective international competition; (d) The interest of the United Nations.""

In conclusion, ID/OIOS finds that UNEP and UNOPS departed from United Nations rules and regulations as described above. These irregularities seem not to have been carried out in bad faith because the urgency of the situation necessitated that BTF become operational rapidly. However, once operational, both organisations should have taken measures to rectify the problems identified in the allegations."

Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001.

In April 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) received information alleging possible violations of UNMIK procurement procedures involving the purchase of insurance cover for the Pristina Airport commencing as of 1 April 2004.

This insurance was obtained by UNMIK with the assistance of the Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration (ICAA). An agreement between UNMIK and the ICAA of 1 April 2004 specified the procedures as follows:

""UNMIK shall, with the assistance of Iceland as described in WPVI-I of ScheduleVI, if requested, obtain and maintain appropriate insurances for the airport, its equipment, facilities, operations, and services from reputable insurers. UNMIK shall, as and when reasonably required by Iceland, provide Iceland with satisfactory evidence of such insurance.

The Investigation Task Force (ITF) has been investigating an allegation regarding administrative irregularities regarding the insurance coverage for Pristina Airport by a London-based Company, who then purchased the cover from Insurance Company 1 between 2001 and 2003.

Based on extensive documentation obtained from UNMIK Pillar II, the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Public Enterprise Airport Pristina (PEAP), the ITF determined that the responsible Manager did not undertake efforts in 2002 or 2003 to invite international tenders for the Airport’s insurance coverage. According to UNMIK regulations 1999/2 – Finance Administration Instruction on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Funds – and in view of the cost of the premiums of more than $125,000 USD, such a tender should have been undertaken. The Manager did not prepare an international tender for at least the period 2 October 2003 to 1 October 2004, instead, he concluded a contract in favour of Insurance Company 1 effecting insurance coverage pertaining to Pristina International Airport for a further year. It should be considered as to whether this conduct demonstrates probable cause with regard to the waste or misappropriation of public funds.

Vendor 1 Manager’s letter also identified his intention to seek legal action against Procurement Officer 1 for allegedly violating “the procurement rules” by: replacing a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee in the competitive tender; allowing a member of the Finance Department, the Finance Officer, to sit on the committee; and favouring Vendor 2 in the tender process."""

Procurement Officer 1 also formed and chaired a Bid Evaluation Committee to assess the offerings of the competitors, which comprised a range of uniforms and accessories for the various categories of airport employees. On 18-06-04, the committee, though not satisfied with all Vendor 2’s samples, tentatively decided in favour of that company, the median bidder in terms of price (Vendor 1 was the highest bidder). The committee resolved that Vendor 2 would be approached to determine the feasibility of no-cost design changes to one of the uniforms for women employees. The committee reconvened on 23-06-04 at the request of Pristina Airport Official. During the meeting, Pristina Airport Official announced the cancellation of the tender.

38.pdf,"""Allegation 2: that Procurement Officer 1 replaced a member of the Bid Evaluation Committee

Procurement Officer 1 explained to the ITF that the original nominee to the committee, Committee member 1, had not been at work on the day that the committee first convened and, therefore, had been replaced by Committee member 2, who then attended the second session for continuity purposes. Committee member 1 and Committee member 2 confirmed Procurement Officer 1’s explanation for the replacement.

The Finance Officer, Procurement Officer 1, and Pristina Airport Official told the ITF that the Finance Officer participated on the Bid Evaluation Committee. However, Procurement Officer 1 and Pristina Airport Official each said that the other had nominated the Finance Officer to the committee.
KTA legal staff advised the ITF that the wisdom of allowing a representative of the Finance Department to participate in bid evaluations is questionable because, generally, officers whose function involves payment should not evaluate contractors to whom payment will become due. According to KTA legal staff, however, such participation is not precluded by any rule or law. Section 23.9.2 of Finance Administration Instruction No. 2/1999 (Revised 15 December 1999) – Public Procurement Using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds precludes only an “approving officer” from the Procuring Entity who will eventually sign a contract from serving as a tender evaluator.

44.pdf,"Allegation

An official of a non-Airport related company, supported the procurement process for the supply of the Flat Information Display System (FIDS) by writing the recommendation and justification for a Single source procurement and also defined the technical specifications. As Vendor 1 was only able to supply but not to cable the FIDS, another tender had to be launched for the FIDS cabling. Winner of this tender was Vendor 2.

Background Information

The Single Source Procurement (Purchase and supply of FIDS) started on 17 October 2002 with a written recommendation and justification by Vendor 2 Representative. The purchase of additional FIDS became necessary because of the expansion of the Passenger Terminal Building. The already existing system had been provided by Vendor 1, therefore the Airport Management decided to choose Vendor 1 again.

The Capital Expenditure Approval and contract were signed on 13 December 2002. The procurement file does not show why Vendor 1 only delivered the FIDS but did not cable it.

Airline Official 1 explained that the Airline paid cash for handling and landing charges to the Pristina Airport Passenger Handling Services Department on each occasion his aircraft used the airport. Airline Official 1 explained that he/she had endeavored to open a credit account with Pristina Airport, but without success.

The ITF sought the assistance of the Security Officer at Pristina Airport, in order to monitor Airline passenger movements. On 22 July 2004, ITF Investigators monitored the Airline’s inward and outward flights and related airport activities. It was noted that whilst the arriving Kosovar passengers went through immigration procedures before entering into the arrivals lounge, the 25 security escorts and the representative of the related Immigration Department remained airside at all times awaiting instructions to return to the aircraft. They did not enter the terminal building."""
47.pdf,"""III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS

ITF Investigators obtained a number of documents from Pristina Airport officials including records of funds received from the Airline for the period January to June 2004. These funds are broken down into handling, landing, airport passenger, and departure tax. The schedule also lists the individual Airport receipt number recorded for each cash payment. There was no record of the Airline having paid airport tax.

ITF Investigators spoke to both Official 1 and Official 2 of the Airline and requested copies of receipts issued by Pristina Airport in respect of fees paid by the Airline to the airport, as well as the Aircraft ""Load Sheets"" for May and June 2004. These documents record details such as the weight of the aircraft including the MTOW (maximum take off weight)."""

The Airline flies to Pristina Airport from a European Airport every Thursday carrying Kosovar passengers who have been found to enter the referred European state illegally. The Airline is contracted with the foreign state’s Immigration Department. A representative of the Immigration Department and 25 or more ""Securicor"" security staff routinely escort the passengers on the flights to Pristina.

On the return leg to the mentioned state, the Airline flight carries passengers from Pristina, consisting of the returning Securicor escorts, the representative of Immigration, and in addition, a number of police officers of the concerned state currently working for UNMIK CIVPOL. These CIVPOL officers travel to the UK without payment, but with the knowledge and approval of both Airline and the U.K. Immigration Department."""

On 27 September 2004, the ITF sent a letter to UNMIK Police Officer 2, in an effort to determine what investigations had been undertaken into the matter, the result of those investigations, and the whereabouts of the money.

The UNMIK Police Officer 2 indicated that Regional Crime Squad Pristina Region was undertaking an investigation into the matter, which therefore remains an open investigation."""
49.pdf,"""INVESTIGATION DETAILS

Analysis of the note written by the PEAP Official suggests that the company referred to in his note as “escavator” is in fact Company 1, who won the contract for the construction of the new car park at Pristina Airport and whose representative attended a meeting in the PEAP Official’s office one day prior to the discovery of the money.

The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since one would expect the sum to have been a “round sum” such as €5000.

It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum from a former Airport Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 26 September 2002, alleged that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelope of documents relating to the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had concluded and contrary to accepted procurement procedures on the handling of bids.

On 29 April 2004, the Divisional Manager advised the ITF of an incident which had occurred “sometime in October 2002”, which he/she “thought” he/she had raised with the ITF previously. However, no evidence of this report could be located nor recalled by any members of the ITF.

The Divisional Manager provided the ITF with a copy of documents passed to an UNMIK police officer, on 11 October 2002 at UNMIK Police in Fush, Kosovo, concerning the incident.

The documents consist of a letter from the Divisional Manager to the UNMIK Police Officer dated 11 October 2002, and a file note from the PEAP Official, dated 8 October 2002, to the Divisional Manager, detailing the incident and annexing a list of serial numbers of Euro notes totalling €5,200 alleged to have been left in the PEAP official’s diary in his office."""

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999.
UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.

Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations,
reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from a member state’s armed forces specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm

On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him/her were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official 1.

On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR, was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.

It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to
the following contract have been examined."
51.pdf,"""IV. CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS

Based on the referral from the ITF to the Department of Justice on 26 July 2004, arrest warrants were issued against Official 1 and Official 2. Each charge is detailed below:

Count 1

That between the dates 14th March 2004 and 16th March 2004 inclusive, Official 1 and Official 2 acting in their capacity as officials of Airport Pristina, and acting in complicity with the intention to obtain an unlawful material benefit, presented a representative of the Company with a false statement of account claiming reduced storage fees, and in so doing, misled an authorized person to carry out an unlawful payment, thereby committing the offence of Fraud in Service in violation of Article 215, (1) and (2) of the Kosovo Criminal Code (KCC) punishable by imprisonment of one to ten years

{equivalent to Fraud in Office contrary to Article 341 (1) and (2) of Provisional Kosovo Criminal Code (PCCK)};

and Complicity, in violation of Article 22 of Criminal Code of SFRY,( equivalent to Co- Perpetration, in violation of PCCK Article 23)"""
51.pdf,"""III. INVESTIGATIVE DETAILS

On the 16th of March 2004, Partner 1 paid the €8,000.00 to the Company Representative, who then went to Pristina Airport to hand it to Official 1. The Company Representative stated that the hand-over of the cash to Official 1 took place outside the airport terminal gate. The Airport X-Ray Operator, who observed the meeting between the two men, corroborated the fact that the meeting took place as stated.

ITF Investigators visited the Cargo Department Finance Office to check official documentation in relation to the Company merchandise. No trace of the payment of the €8,000 could be found in the Cargo Department account books for 2003 or 2004.

According to the tariff list that the Finance Officer of the Cargo Section provided to the ITF, the Company should have paid an amount of approximately €32,000.00 for storage fees from the 23rd of December 2003 to 15th of March 2004."""
51.pdf,""" II. Background

ITF Investigators met with the Company Representative, who explained that a part of his business involves the importation and marketing of LED display equipment. The Company consists of 4 partners:
• Partner 1
• Partner 2
• Partner 3
• Partner 4

The above company partners agreed to the following regarding the various payments to be effected as follows:
• Partner 2 and Partner 3 were to pay the total price of all the goods;
• Partner 1 was to pay everything regarding VAT, Custom Duties, Local Taxes and Storage.

III. THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF AIRPORT PRISTINA CARGO OFFICIALS

It was Official 2’s responsibility to ensure that storage fees were paid and a record of the payments be kept. The procedure for recording payments is that the airway bill with a customs stamp should have been provided to the Finance Officer whereby he/she then calculates the storage fees owed. Before individuals or companies were allowed to retrieve their goods, this fee had to be paid pursuant to an official invoice. In this instant case, there is no record of such an invoice or any such payment. The absence of such a record is highly unusual and establishes that monies owed to the airport were not received in this case.

Official 1 worked in the Cargo Handling Office at the Airport. As with Official 2, it was Official 1’s duty to ensure that all payments made by customers of the airport complied with the applicable regulations and instructions."""
52.pdf,"""APPLICABLE TERRITORIAL LAWS:

Pursuant to the authority given to The Special Representative of the Secretary-General, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999, taking into account United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) Regulation No. 1999/1 of 25 July 1999 on the Authority of the Interim Administration in Kosovo, for the purpose of defining the law applicable in Kosovo, the SRSG promulgated that the law applicable in Kosovo shall be:
a. The regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and subsidiary instruments issued thereunder; and

b. The law in force in Kosovo on 22 March 1989.

69.pdf,"INTRODUCTION
On 13 February 2005, the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received a request from UNON Official 1 to inquire into allegations that locally recruited United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON) staff may have engaged in improper conduct by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments showing longer contract duration dates to obtain loans from the United Nations Co-operative Savings and Credit Society Limited (UN-SACCO), which operates within UNON premises. The request was prompted by an earlier report submitted to UNON Management by UNON Official 2, on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff members from the Nairobi-based United Nations Children’s Fund/Somalia Support Centre (UNICEF/Somalia) obtained UN-SACCO loans by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments to UN-SACCO. The primary concern of UNON Management was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spread to UNON and other Nairobi based United Nations Agencies."
69.pdf,"The request was prompted by an earlier report submitted to UNON Management by UNON Official 2, on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff members from the Nairobi-based United Nations Children’s Fund/Somalia Support Centre (UNICEF/Somalia) obtained UN-SACCO loans by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments to UN-SACCO. The primary concern of UNON Management was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spread to UNON and other Nairobi based United Nations Agencies. At the time of the request, two ID/OIOS Investigators were on mission to Nairobi on another matter, but given the concerns expressed by UNON Managers, the ID/OIOS Investigators were directed by ID/OIOS Management to look into this matter with celerity, and did so, from 14 through 18 February 2005. The purpose of this report is to present the findings of the preliminary ID/OIOS Investigation together with recommendations for appropriate action by UNON Management."
69.pdf,"ID/OIOS could not interview all UNICEF staff or former staff involved in the fraud. For example, one staff member passed away and another, who had left UNICEF, declined the interview. In addition, the UNICEF inquiry was not final and information obtained primarily through the interviews of UNICEF staff by ID/OIOS suggested that there might be more UNICEF staff involved than initially envisaged. During their interviews with ID/OIOS, the concerned UNICEF staff confirmed that they misused UNICEF letterhead and official seal, indicated that they forged the signature of a UNICEF Operations officer and that they provided UN-SACCO with incorrect information about the duration of their contracts in order to obtain loans. All of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed official UNICEF stamps, stationeries and computers, although given the limited responsibilities of some of them, for example, the drivers, such access should not have occurred.
Further, most interviewees stated that they acted alone and, with one exception, all denied that either their UNICEF or UNON colleagues assisted them in their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise aware of or involved in such improper actions."
69.pdf,"Further, whenever the ID/OIOS Investigators noted apparent irregularities concerning letters of appointments or other similar documents produced by these staff to UN-SACCO, for example letters suggesting that their contracts would be renewed beyond the expiration date of their contracts, the ID/OIOS officers made copies of those documents and compared them with the corresponding documentation available in the Official Status Files of those staff and/or confirmed with UNON officials whose signatures appeared on those letters that they had indeed signed them. The ID/OIOS Investigators noted with concern that in January 2005, one Senior UNEP Manager had informed UN-SACCO management that the contract of a particular staff member is likely to be extended for a further two years, subject to satisfactory performance. During the manager’s interview with ID/OIOS, s/he admitted s/he had written a letter at the request of the staff member and advised that such letters are sometimes provided to UN-SACCO so that locally recruited staff can obtain loans. ID/OIOS cautions managers that the issuance of these letters may give the impression that a staff member’s contract will be renewed."
69.pdf,"Interviews with UN-SACCO and UNON staff UN-SACCO and UNON staff members interviewed by the ID/OIOS Investigators provided general information about their operations and otherwise cooperated with the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing unhindered access to their files. However, these interviews did not produce conclusive information to either suggest or completely rule out improper conduct on the part of UNON staff members. Additional Investigative steps Documentation obtained from UN-SACCO shows that about 2,500 staff members from UNON and other United Nations related organizations have requested and obtained UN-SACCO loans, about one thousand of whom are UNON staff. Given the large number of records to review, which would then need to be compared to similar records from UNON, and the absence of any identified subjects, the ID/OIOS Investigators decided to do a thorough review of a sampling of cases. Files were selected for review where the loan amount was high, the duration of the contract long, or the applicant was also a guarantor on other loans."
69.pdf,"The Administrative Officer requested a copy of the appointment letter and found that it was fraudulent, in that the date of the expiration of the contract was false and the signature of a UNICEF Operations Officer named in the letter was forged. Upon further inquiries from UN-SACCO managers, UNICEF/Somalia Management started an inquiry and found that other UNICEF/Somalia staff members had obtained similarly improper loans. UNICEF/Somalia has only approximately 20 staff members. The results of this inquiry were described in a “Report on the preliminary investigation of a case of fraudulent signatures and use of office stationary and official seal – UNICEF Somalia, Nairobi”, dated 11 February 2005, which included copies of the false letters of appointment and written statements of several locally recruited UNICEF staff who admitted their improper conduct.

69.pdf,"To obtain an individual loan, a staff member is required to complete either a “Loan Application & Loan Agreement Form” (Attachment 3) or an “Instant Loan Facility Application & Agreement Form” (Attachment 4). The staff member must attach to his/her request documents including copies of his/her latest payslip, National Identification Card or Passport and a copy of his/her letter of contract. A copy of the letter of contract is required to ensure that the applicant holds a valid contract, which covers the agreed period of time for the repayment of the loan. The benefit of a longer contract is that it permits repayment in lesser amounts over a longer period of time. To ensure guarantee of repayment, the applicant must provide up to six guarantors in the event of the borrower’s default. The guarantors must also be UN SACCO members. The applications for loans are reviewed by UN-SACCO staff and a Credit Committee, which approve, defer, or reject the application."

73.pdf,"""VI. FINDINGS

The UNON/ITS Staff Member had intended to use expensive equipment from the UNON workshop, but did not receive permission to do so from his/her supervisor prior to his/her arrangement with UNPOS. When the UNON Official learned of these arrangements, s/he told the UNON/ITS Staff Member the equipment could not be used by UNPOS and that a request for extension of the satellite link must go though the proper channels.

UNPOS did not receive an extension of its satellite link to the residence and the UNON/ITS Staff Member did not return the money paid him/her.

VII. CONCLUSION

By personally undertaking to extend the satellite link to the RSG residence, receiving money for said undertaking, failing to provide the satellite link and refusing to return the money paid to him/her, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obligations under Staff Regulation 1.2

By personally undertaking to extend the satellite link to the RSG residence, the UNON/ITS Staff Member acted contrary to his/her obligations under The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations ST/SGB/2003/7, Regulation 5.12."""

UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.

Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs.

82.pdf,"In February, 2002, DPKO Communications and Technology Services Division (CITS) sought to obtain a new systems contract for laptop computers. Mr. Cabrera was the procurement officer in the procurement department (PD) assigned to this matter. The Chief of CITS communicated his request to PD, and on February 25, 2002 an expression of interest was issued by PD. An invitation to bid followed on April 15, 2002 which was transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries. CITS advised PD that they desired only “IBM, Dell and Compaq” based on ITSD standards for desktop computers. On the other hand, PD and the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), involved in the process by Mr. Bahel, recommended adding Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC to the list. In a subsequent exchange of emails between PD and the requisitioner (CITS and ITSD), CITS continued to assert that they sought only the three major brands of computers to avoid “inferior products,” laptops from “questionable manufacturers,” “clones” and “home built computers.” Ultimately, however, CITS agreed that they were amenable to expanding the field to include other major brands of computer manufacturers who were recognized industry leaders. As a result, on April 24, 2002, the case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated quantity of the computers sought, and clarifying that that only “Compaq, Dell, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation."
82.pdf,"This is a report dealing with the matters raised (1) in the audit report dated 26 January 2006 PD/155/02 and (2) raised in other referrals concerning Mr. Walter Cabrera, procurement officer, Headquarters Procurement Section, at relevant times. The following sets forth the findings of the Procurement Task Force concerning United Nations staff member Walter Cabrera. INTRODUCTION The Procurement Task Force was created on January 12, 2006 to address all procurement matters referred to the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). The creation of the Task Force was the result of perceived problems in procurement identified by the Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil for Food Programme (IIC), and the arrest and conviction of UN procurement officer Alexander Yakovlev."
82.pdf,"Under its Terms of Reference, the Task Force operates as part of OIOS, and reports directly to the Under Secretary General of OIOS. The remit of the Task Force is to investigate all open and pending procurement cases, including all matters involving the procurement bidding exercises, procurement staff, and vendors doing business with the United Nations (hereinafter “UN” or “Organization”). The mandate of the Task Force also includes a review in some procurement matters which have been closed, but it is nevertheless determined that further investigative effort is warranted. The Task Force’s investigations have also focused upon a myriad of individuals and vendors doing business with the Organization. Some of these matters are particularly complex and span significant periods of time. Since its inception, more than 200 matters, involving numerous procurement cases in various UN Missions and UN Headquarters have been referred to the Task Force. The Task Force will report on matters individually. The Task Force has given priority to the matters involving the eight staff members placed on special leave with pay."
82.pdf,"The purpose of this report is to address the matters raised in the audit findings of January 2006 concerning Walter Cabrera, a United Nations procurement officer, and another matter brought to the attention of the Task Force through a separate referral. First, Mr. Cabrera is alleged to have improperly provided notification to a prospective vendor that approval had been granted in favor of the vendor, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird) for a contract to provide manpower support in UN Missions, prior to the official award of the contract. Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in substantial contracts ultimately awarded to the firm Telecommunications Consultants of India (TCIL). The audit report found significant fraud indicators in connection with the procurement exercises in these contracts, a conclusion with which the Task Force agrees. (The Task Force will report on these issues in much more detail in a subsequent report addressing related matters). However, the focus of this report is upon the conduct of Mr. Cabrera individually, and whether Mr. Cabrera acted improperly in his participation in these matters."
82.pdf,"However, the investigation has revealed Mr. Bahel’s personal involvement in ensuring that the vendor, Thunderbird, received advanced notice of the likely award. Other than the HCC secretary, Mr. Bahel is also the only individual associated with the request for expedited approval in a position to seek it. The need for expedited approval for Thunderbird in the first instance and the effort to notify Thunderbird quickly of a likely award is questionable in light of the fact that in the same HCC meeting the current vendor, IECS, was granted an extension to continue for an additional two months, and that Thunderbird had failed to submit audited financial statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task. (However, Thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms). Thus, the basis for the intensive effort by Mr. Bahel to notify Thunderbird is problematic, especially in light of the fact that Thunderbird’s application was still not yet complete. Curiously, there is no request for advanced notification to IECS of the expedited approval of their extension.
While the minutes of the HCC meeting were pending and not yet finalized, however, a one page form had been issued by the HCC granting expedited approval for both the continuation of the current contractor, and for the replacement, Thunderbird. The circumstances surrounding the creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first instance are troubling, and are a continued subject of the Task Force’s investigation. However, at present, there is no evidence in the possession of the Task Force which demonstrates Mr. Cabrera participated in this aspect of the matter."
82.pdf,"After the HCC presentation, Mr. Bahel, who was scheduled to leave New York for annual leave, convened a meeting with Ms. Jane Redfern, a UN procurement officer, and Mr. Walter Cabrera prior to his departure. In this meeting, Mr. Bahel instructed them to notify Thunderbird of the recommendation to award the contract to them. According to Mr. Cabrera, he understood that he was not able to provide a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Thunderbird, but was able to give verbal notification of the HCC’s action based upon the document issued by the HCC. Mr. Cabrera’s understanding that this action was permissible was based upon the fact that his supervisor, Mr. Bahel, directed him to do it, as well as his independent understanding at the time. At the direction of Mr. Bahel, Mr. Cabrera did in fact notify Mr. Nishan Kohli that the HCC had recommended that the contract be awarded to Thunderbird and that Thunderbird would likely receive the contract. Mr. Cabrera asserts that he further notified Mr. Kohli that PD could not issue an LOI prior to receiving the approved HCC minutes and formal award of the contract. (Mr. Kohli’s explanation of the events in his written submission to the Organization through his attorney materially differs, however the Task Force does not find Mr. Kohli’s representations credible)."
82.pdf,"On July 18, 2002, Sanjaya Bahel, the Officer in Charge of Procurement at the time, recommended the award to TCIL for a systems contract in the amount of US$5,340,000. In the presentation of the matter to the HCC, officials questioned the basis for limiting the bidding exercise to the three specified brands and intimated that the PD violated UN rules and regulations by the use of brand names in its ITB. Email communication after the event describes a circumstance in which DPKO officials are questioned about the limitation of the re-solicitation to the three preferred brands. The HCC stated that “were it not for the imminent loss of funds, the Committee would have recommended that a re-bidding exercise be conducted inviting all brands of laptops that met the UN’s requirement.” Nevertheless, the proposed contract award to TCIL was ultimately approved, and signed."
82.pdf,"Nonetheless, it is clear that a new invitation to bid (ITB) was issued. The basis for this renewed ITB however is not clear, nor is the identity of the individual(s) who sought it. The Task Force has not identified any evidence to support a finding that Mr. Cabrera was involved in the decision and the documents demonstrate that Mr. Cabrera continued to maintain a dialogue with DPKO concerning its requests. Further, the Task Force has not identified evidence which suggests Mr. Cabrera sought to cancel the bid, and then seek a re-bidding exercise. The investigation has revealed however that Mr. Cabrera’s supervisor, Sanjaya Bahel, was intimately involved in the matter, and interjected himself in it, communicating with ITSD officials and DPKO officials. The DPKO official referred to above stated that he had conversations with Mr. Bahel in which Mr. Bahel confirmed that PD was of the view that there was a technical issue with LaCresta’s bid, and there should be a new bidding exercise."
82.pdf,"The facts of this matter as they relate to Mr. Cabrera are not in dispute. In May, 2002, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird), through Mr. Nishan Kohli, its Managing Partner, had submitted an application in support of registering with the Organization as a vendor authorizing it to submit proposals on upcoming UN contracts. In July, 2002, after successfully being registered by PD, Thunderbird, through Nishan Kohli, submitted a proposal for the supply of engineering manpower to various UN Missions in response to the RFP issued by the Procurement Department. Ultimately, Mr. Sanjaya Bahel, Chief of Field Procurement, had made a presentation to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts (HCC) in favor of the award to Thunderbird. The matter had not been assigned to Mr. Cabrera until late December, 2002, and he was involved in the case only peripherally until that time."
82.pdf,"Procurement Department officials concede that at this point there was no further issue and there was no justification not to award the contract to LaCresta. Indeed, no justification is provided to La Cresta, or found in the file. It seems that La Cresta was not formally informed of the cancellation. (Typically the case officer maintains the responsibility for communicating the cancellation to the vendor.) In this case, there is no correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying them of the cancellation. A DPKO official involved in the process has informed the Task Force that in conversations with PD in this interim period, it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an “issue” with LaCresta’s submission. According to the official, the Procurement Department suggested a re-bid because of a “technicality.” While the official objected, he was told that because the matter is a commercial one it is only within PD’s prerogative to cancel the bid on the basis of commercial non-compliance. This explanation is not persuasive as there was no commercial or technical issue with LaCresta’s bid. DPKO had found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder. Mr. Cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffered by PD to the DPKO official is not sound, but takes issue with any claim participation by him in the exchange or decision."
89.pdf,"""Another proposed topic was efforts by the European Aeronautic, Defense, and Space Corporation (EADS) to win a tanker aircraft contract with the U.S. military. Vimont revealed cryptically that the deal is moving forward but did not provide any details. Levitte had not expected to put the labeling dispute with Pernod Ricard (the world's second largest spirits group) on the agenda, but Sarkozy had just spoken to the company's chairman who had asked the president to intercede on his behalf. (COMMENT: Patrick Ricard, chairman of the Pernod Ricard board of directors, is said to be one of Sarkozy's wealthy backers.) Vimont characterized the issue as a very political matter in the U.S., and suggested that a direct appeal to the White House might be useful. While Sarkozy intends to broach the issue with the U.S. President, Levitte will talk to the U.S. President's Economic Adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser. Finally, Levitte expected the two leaders to discuss other pressing subjects including Iran, the Middle East Peace Process, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, the Sahel, Russia, China, Turkey, climate change, and the financial situation of several European countries; however, he provided no details on those topics."

(TS//SI//NF) French President Sarkozy intends to raise a number of sensitive topics with the U.S. President when the two leaders meet in Washington on 31 March, according to an exchange last week between the French ambassador in Washington Pierre Vimont, and Sarkozy's diplomatic advisor, Jean-David Levitte. Vimont conveyed that the French President will express his frustration that Washington has backed away from its proposed bilateral intelligence cooperation agreement and Sarkozy intends to continue to push for closure. As Vimont and Levitte understand it, the main sticking point is the U.S. desire to continue spying on France. On the topic of Afghanistan, Levitte noted that Sarkozy is ready to authorize more military trainers but wants clarification on how many are needed, given the conflicting figures from U.S. sources."""

The extract dating from March 24, 2010 summarises communications between the French Ambassador in Washington D.C. Pierre Vimont, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's diplomatic advisor Jean-David Levitte. The report reveals various potential topics Sarkozy intended to raise with US President Barack Obama during an upcoming meeting in Washington. Topping Sarkozy's agenda is his frustration that the US has backed away from a bilaterial intelligence cooperation agreement which might restrict the US ability to continue spying on France. Other issues include the potential French commitment of military trainers to Afghanistan, a potential European Aeronautic Defence and Space Corporation (EADS) contract for tanker aircraft with the US military, and a trademark dispute concerning the French spirits company Pernod Ricard."""

This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered Accountants which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina International Airport.
It is alleged that a single source contract for one container was added one month after a main contract for the supply of two new containers and the dismantling, transport and re-construction of a further seven containers at Pristina Airport.

METHODOLOGY

This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand."""

Interception of French Ambassador in Washington Jean-David Levitte reveals his frustration towards a report from Iraq Survey Group and its finding that the UN Oil-for-food program was possibly misused by French companies. In the interception Levitte states that it is scandalous that no U.S. companies are named in the report and claimed that many French companies named were actually subsidiaries of U.S. firms.

(TS//SI) French Envoy Plans to Release List of U.S. Firms Who
Allegedly Profited From OFF

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL) French Ambassador Jean­ David Levitte in Washington plans to respond as early as today to information in the Iraq Survey Group report regarding possible misuse of the UN Oil­for­Food (OFF) program by companies from France and other countries during the former Iraqi regime. The ambassador termed the report scandalous, since it named no U.S. companies and he claimed that many French companies with contracts under the OFF program were actually subsidiaries of U.S. firms that also profited from the business dealings. He therefore planned, with foreign ministry backing, to present a list of these U.S. companies to both the U.S. Congress and the media."""
